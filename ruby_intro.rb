# Lesson 1: Ruby Introduction

# Setting variables in Ruby is super simple. For example:
my_name =("Kyle")

# Whenever you call my_name, Kyle will be the result.
# To print the output to the screen, you could use the 'print' method, or the 'puts' method.
# Try them both out to see the difference between them.
# To run this from the command line, navigate to the directory of the saved Ruby file, and type ruby your_filename.rb, then press enter.

puts(my_name)
print(my_name)

# Notice that the 'puts' method inserts a new line after the output, while 'print' does not.
# Lets practice printing output to the screen!
# ***The parentheses can be left off as well, Ruby doesn't care! I use them because I prefer them.***

# Exercise 1: Set a variable 'name' to equal your name. Print it to the console. Don't be afraid to experiment!!
# Exercise 2: Create a few variables. See if you can figure out how to string them together in the output. Hint: +
